## Compiling the mod
[Installing a stable release from Nexus Mods](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/533/) is
recommended. If you really want to compile the mod yourself, just edit `Pathoschild.StardewValley.SkipIntro.csproj`
and set the `<GamePath>` setting to your Stardew Valley directory path. Launching the project in Visual
Studio will compile the code, package it into the mod directory, and start the game.
